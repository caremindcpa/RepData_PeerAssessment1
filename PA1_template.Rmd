## Loading and preprocessing the data
Unzip data to obtain a csv file.

```{r}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'))
unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip")

## Reading csv Data into Data.Table. 
```{r}
activity<- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
Total_Steps <- activity[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
head(Total_Steps, 10)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
Interval <- activity[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 
ggplot(Interval, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
Interval[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```

## Imputing missing values

1.Calculate the total number of missing values in the dataset ( The total number of rows with NAs)
```{r}
nrow(activity[is.na(steps),])
```
2.Filling in missing values in the dataset.
```{r}
# Filling in missing values with median of dataset. 
activity[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset with missing values in. 
```{r}
data.table::fwrite(x = activity, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```
4. Plot a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{r}
# total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activity[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
# mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
# Just recreating activityDT from scratch then making the new factor variable. (No need to, just want to be clear on what the entire process is.) 
activity<- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activity[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activity[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activity[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activity[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activity[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activity, 10)
```

2. Create a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

```{r}
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
```
